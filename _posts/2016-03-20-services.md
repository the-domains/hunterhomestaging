# Vacant Home Staging

After our initial meeting and viewing of your home, we will bring in the appropriate furniture, lighting, art and accessories for the style, character and price point of your home. We will create "life-style" staging, targeted towards the potential buyer. You may choose to stage the entire home or just a few key rooms. Prices varies on square footage and price point of the home. Please call for a quote.

# Staging Consultation

We will offer you a professional analysis of your home's marketability and provide suggestions so that you can realize the benefits of staging on your own. A room-by-room walk through of your home will be performed to address clutter, furniture placement, lighting, colors, and accessories. Appointments last approximately two to three hours. ($75/hr)
